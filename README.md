# Docker Deployment
- Have docker installed & running
- Run `docker compose up -d --build` at the root of the project
- Docker will take over and build the two dockerfiles located in the frontend & backend
- Frontend Port: `localhost:5173`
- Backend Port: `localhost:3001` - `/api/health` - `/expenses`

# MVP for Sprint 2 Deliverable (Xavier & Jacob)

- Add ability to upload images
    - may need to update table for db
    - may need to find additional libaries for adding 

- Add description on side bar within finance history
    - may need to manipulate css
    - may need to add logic for appending data to div

# MVP for Sprint 3 Deliverable (Tim & Jesse)

- **Add more Category selections**: We can add stuff like *Car-Parts*, *Groceries*, *Computer-Hardware*, *Gaming-Mouses*, etc. 
    - Update React backend and frontend to have different selections

- **Fix up Finance History**: It looks good they added the Description, but it could still use more work. I wouldn't want a Client seeing this.
    - Make the added history easier to read
    - Make images be closer to the size they are
    - Fix timeslot

- **General CSS Work**: Wireframe is great, but lets start moving towards production and pretend as if this was going to be seen by a client. 
    - Start to make the app fill the entire page, everything is kind of just shoved on there right now
    - Center divs, enlarge buttons, fix overall format

- **Use python pandas for Finance Goals?**: SDEV494 is currently teaching us Pandas, why not try and further that knowledge and use it on a real application.
    - Use the df.plot(kind = "bar") or df.plot(kind = "scatter") possibly for adding a graph within the SPA


# MVP for Sprint 4 Deliverable (Xavier & Jacob)
- **Delete button - Finace History**: We are able to add to our finace history but we would like the ability to delete or remove them.
    - Add functionality to remove past purchases from finance history
    - Need logic for a button that can add and delete a category
    - Need logic for removing from the Database (100% remove from Database)
- **Add Category Button**: We want logic for adding specfic categories to our finace history, we only have hard coded values now and would like for users to be specifc.
    - Add functionality to add new categories to the category drop down
    - Button near or on the dropdown for the categories
- **Fix timestamp**: Right now our timestamp is *2026-02-19T00:00:00.000Z* this is kind of unhuman to read.
    - Format times to be easier to read when they are added to the finace history
- **Look into Finance Chart**
    - Look into creating a pie chart that counts the spending for a product
